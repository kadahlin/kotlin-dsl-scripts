# kotlin-dsl-scripts example

Android Studio 3.4 Preview project showing how to use the Kotlin DSL in an android project to apply gradle tasks across modules. The repo is made as a 
companion to https://medium.com/@kyle.dahlin0/custom-gradle-scripts-using-kotlin-dsl-b6a0247d6f5 . There wasn't a clear 
sample online that shows how to do what I was looking to accomplish with scripts and the Kotlin DSL. Hopefully in the future there 
is a more officially documented way to do this.
